# Gambling-Behaviour-Analysis
### The impact of socio-economic factors on gambling behaviour in England : this study focuses on the socio-economic factors that impact gambling behaviour, with the aim of shedding light on the underlying reasons why people gamble.


### Key Findings:
- If we plot the percentage of total expenditure by disposable income groups by age-gender, while some of the trends that we see were expected, we did identify some anomalies.
- For, instance in both males and females young people tend to spend a higher percentage of their disposable income on gambling activities possibly due to lack of financial experience, succumbing to peer pressure, advertising catered towards youth etc.


#### - But one of the most interesting trends that came out of this analysis was that middle-aged females had a higher average weekly spend on gambling (in terms of disposable income) than their male counterparts.

- If we divide the number of gambling establishments by the population of each city we observed an interesting trend, coastal towns like Skegness (30+ establishments per 10,000 people), Great Yarmouth, Blackpool, Liverpool, Southampton etc. end up quite high up on the tree, while the major cities like London (1 establishment per 10k people) end up right at the bottom.

- One possible explanation for this trend could be that the coastal towns have a higher concentration of casinos, betting, shops and amusement arcades which often attract a lot of tourists. Another factor could be that a lot of these coastal towns have high levels of deprivation and poverty which often leads to an increase in demand for activities like gambling as a means of making quick and easy money.

### Summary

The societal and economic impacts of gambling are well documented and have been the focus of many studies not excluded
to the Public Health England and Gambling Commission studies. Rather than focusing on the factors caused by gambling
behaviour, this study will focus on the socio-economic factors that impact gambling behaviour, with the aim of shedding
light on the underlying reasons why people gamble. The aim of the model is to predict gambling activity (i.e. whether
someone is likely to participate in gambling activity or not) based on socio-economic factors. This research is essential in
understanding the dynamics of gambling and the formation of gambling habits, which can help elicit some understanding
and help provide support to at-risk groups. Furthermore, by using a data science approach, it allows an opportunity to extract
valuable insights from vast amounts of data and apply machine learning techniques. The insights that are drawn from these
methods can help develop effective interventions and policies to address the causes of gambling and problem gambling.
